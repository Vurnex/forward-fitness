# Forward Fitness

A project to build a website for Forward Fitness. This project was originally completed in Spring 2019 during my Freshman year of College (IT Major).

### What I learned or noticed while revisiting the project

 - I noticed that there is proper tag usage which is good for accessibility. Tags such as nav, main, article, header, footer, and more.
 - I remembered the usage for dl, dt, and dd tags. They can be used for descriptions containing definitions or terms.
